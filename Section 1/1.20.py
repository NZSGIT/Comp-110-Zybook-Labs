1.20 LAB*: Program: ASCII art
This zyLab activity is the traditional programming assignment, typically requiring a few hours over a week. The previous sections provide warm up exercises intended to help a student prepare for this programming assignment.



(1) Output this tree. (Submit for 2 points).

   *
  ***
 *****
*******
  ***

(2) Below the tree (with two blank lines), output this cat. (Submit for 3 points, so 5 points total).

/\   /\
  o o
 =   =
  ---
Hint: A backslash \ in a string acts as an escape character, such as with a newline \n. So, to print an actual backslash, escape that backslash by prepending another backslash. Ex: The following prints a single backslash: print('\\')
